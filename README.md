# Term-Deposit-Prediction-Model

#### The investment and portfolio department of the Bank of Portugal has been conducting direct marketing campaigns to identify potential customers who would subscribe to their term deposits

#### The objective of our analysis is to develop a robust machine learning algorithm to predict if a potential client will subscribe to the Bankâ€™s term deposits

#### This dataset is popular for use in both academic and educational settings. And you can find analysis of it in academic articles and on sites such as Kaggle

#### The project focuses primarily on feature selection and model performance. In our analysis, we are looking to achieve high predictive accuracy but also gain an understanding of the variables that contribute to the predictions in order to generate specific business recommendations.
